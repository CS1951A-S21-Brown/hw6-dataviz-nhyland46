1. For the football dataset, question 1 asked to show the number of football games per year, and my graph #1 shows the number of football games per year over the last decade. 
Question 2 asked to show the top winning nations based on all-time win percentage, and my second graph is a bar graph which shows the top 10 nations based upon overall win percentage.
Question 3 asked to show which teams were most likely to win the next World Cup based upon the last 2 World Cups. I chose to use the win percentage in the last 2 
World Cups and Qualifying Games in order to show this. I thought about using margin of victory as a factor in the "most likely to win" calculation, but I felt that 
one blowout win over a potentially very poor team would have too much of an effect if I included margin of victory.

2. D3 is a helpful visualization tool for because it allows you to embed a visualization within a website. In addition, because d3 visualizations are brought into the 
html for a website, it allows for user interaction with the chart. Lastly, d3 helped my visualization because it allows you to easily create color gradients, 
which improved the visual appeal of my graphs. 
<br> <br> 
3. D3 would not be the ideal for creating a more complex type of visualization, as there is already a lot of code necessary for these simpler graphs, and more 
complex visualizations would only become more tedious. In addition, d3 would not be ideal if you didn't need the visualization to show up in the html for a website, 
but rather only wanted the image of the visualization itself. There would be simpler ways to create these graphs. Lastly, d3 only has a certain number of chart 
types, so if you had a dataset that couldn't be represented with the available charts, you'd be better off using another visualization tool. 
<br><br> 
4. Overall, I think my visualization is very accessible for most groups. I did not include colors like green and red together, and instead I used a color scheme that 
is colorblind friendly. In addition, there is clear white space between the different features of my graph, so someone with Deuteronopia would have little trouble 
understanding my charts. Lastly, the article mentions that in order to better support assistive technology, intricate tools like sliders as well as hover overlays 
should be avoided. I did not include either of these features in my charts, and I believe that mine should be accessible to someone using assistive technology.

5. One example of when I could have taken steps to make my graph a bit more accessible to all audiences was when I was creating the line graph of 
football games played by year. According to one of the articles, it is best to always label data directly, so I thought about directly labeling the line 
as "count". However, because this was the only data being shown in this graph, I felt that it made sense to simply leave "count" as a y-axis label.
